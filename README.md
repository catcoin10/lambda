Lambda "busy beaver"

This is a computer science project dedicated to the busy beaver function. It uses binary SKI calculus (I presume it is SKI calculus without the I), and appears to be on a similar trajectory as the busy beaver function.

Note. Lambda2 is designed to grow faster than the busy beaver function eventually. It is basically like the Xi function in googology wiki. The Lambda2 function will be what is studied. It is one of the fastest growing functions ever defined, and is similar in both nature and growth rate to Goucher's Xi function.   

To verify results:

1. Download Lambda.py
2. Go into python and type in:
"import Lambda"
"Lambda.exec_prog(PROG)"
