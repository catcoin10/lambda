Lambda "busy beaver"

This is a computer science project dedicated to the busy beaver function. It uses binary SKI calculus (I presume it is SKI calculus without the I), and appears to be on a similar trajectory as the busy beaver function.

To verify results:

1. Download Lambda.py
2. Go into python and type in:
"import Lambda"
"Lambda.exec_prog(PROG)"
